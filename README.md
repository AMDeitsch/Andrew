# Plotting Hurricane Andrew

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks for plotting Hurrinane Andrew using HURDAT2 and ERA5 data.

This originally began as part of an assignment for a class.

HURDAT2 Best Track Data can be found at https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat

and ERA5 data was acquired using the [UCAR Thredds Server](https://thredds.rda.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog/catalog.html).
